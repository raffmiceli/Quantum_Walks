# Quantum_Walks
Qiskit code to simulate quantum walks on graphs with up to 4 nodes

2_qubit_quantum_walk.py - Python file that runs the quantum simulation

AdjMat Generator.nb - Mathematica notebook used to generate adjacency matrices (For the 2-qubit case this function could easily be subsumed into the Python file, but the Mathematica file makes it easier to illustrate and animate the graphs.)

adjmat.txt - Example adjacency matrix text file
